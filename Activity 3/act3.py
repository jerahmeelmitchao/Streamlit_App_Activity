A **Data Warehouse (DW)** is a centralized repository designed to store integrated data from various sources to support **business intelligence (BI)**, reporting, and decision-making. 
It is optimized for querying and analysis rather than transaction processing.

Modern data warehouses consolidate structured and semi-structured data, enabling **historical analysis, trend discovery, and performance tracking** over time.

While operational databases (OLTP) are optimized for real-time transactions and updates, **data warehouses (OLAP)** are optimized for **analytical queries and aggregations**.
They typically involve large-scale data, complex queries, and historical datasets.

- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: Pipelines that extract data from source systems, clean and transform it, and load it into the warehouse.
- **Data Staging Area**: Temporary storage where raw data is held before transformation.
- **Data Integration Layer**: Processes and combines data from various sources into a unified schema.
- **Data Presentation Layer**: Where end-users access the data through BI tools and dashboards.
- **Metadata Repository**: Stores technical and business metadata (data about data).

A **Star Schema** uses a central fact table linked to dimension tables, offering simplicity and fast queries.  
A **Snowflake Schema** normalizes dimension tables, reducing data redundancy but increasing query complexity.

Choosing between them depends on data size, performance requirements, and complexity of business logic.
